                <p>Through partnerships and collaborating with engineering teams, to promote security, standards, and
                    best practices in SDLC, to accelerate innovation and application modernization on the journey to the
                    cloud.</p>

                <p>Continuously and accurately deliver working software on time that meets business requirements with
                    high qualities including highly secure, low defect rates, and high performance.</p>

                        We think about protecting the customer in everything we do.
                        Not doing so risks tarnishing our reputation. It means we are
                        all security advocates. We read, understand and comply with
                        security policies and standards. We think about and work hard to
                        produce secure, high-quality solutions.

                        Code is not owned by a single person. It is owned by the
                        entire team, including management. We all play a vital
                        role in producing secure, high-quality software. If the code
                        is not measuring up, then the entire team is responsible.

                        developers review all changes being made by their team.
                        If the proposed changes will alter a solutions’ architecture,
                        then they seek to collaborate appropriately with others to
                        obtain other opinions and support for the changes.

                        Quality is a team effort. Our developers strive to prevent
                        defects and understand the value of testing their own code.
                        If a defect is discovered downstream then they “shift left” by
                        creating unit tests to catch these defects the next time.

                    <li class="principle">Rigorously Review</li>
                    <content class="principle-content">
                        Code reviews are essential. We regularly and rigorously perform
                        them. Developers do not let code go into the Master Branch
                        without it being reviewed for tests, quality and security. Managers
                        ensure that code reviews are appropriately performed. Everyone
                        is responsible if bad code or untested code makes it through to
                        production.

                    <li class="principle">Less but Better</li>
                    <content class="principle-content">
                        It has been said that perfection is achieved, not when there is
                        nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
                        Code is no different. Good software developers understand the risk
                        of stale code. They are relentless in striving to keep it clean and
                        relevant. Every line is a potential defect or security flaw. Reducing
                        code reduces risk. Unit tests should allow you to confidently do so.

                        Software development is always evolving. So are the best
                        practices guiding how we create and secure it. We are expected,
                        at all levels, to continuously learn and educate ourselves about
                        these best practices using all resources available to us.
